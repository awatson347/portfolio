                    <p>Originally from Detroit Michigan however I have considered myself a Floridian for a long time.  
I graduated from Jones High School 4th generation so coming to Florida helped me complete a long standing tradition. 
.</p>
                    <p>Once I graduated I attended Florida State University for several years, before returning to Orlando to take care of my grandmother, during this time I was able to graduate from ITT Tech with a Bachelors in Electronic Engineering.  I was picked up by AT&T Wifeless as a technical service advisor, during which I helped program and test some of the beginning of applications that would become today's internet enabled phones (smartphones) and text messaging services. While working for AT&T I was promoted several time and received many hours of training at the AT&T Wireless head office in Seattle Washington. I was the first On-line Technical Service Manager in Florida and helped the create what is today their On-line Service model. </p>
                    <p>Once my position was moved to Seattle permanently I transitioned into a Project Manager position with InCharge debt solutions a local debt management company that wanted to move their debt counseling process on-line. I worked with my internal IT group along with an outside contractor to produce a top notch web interface that cut Cost per Contact from$77.00 per to $24.00. It was also the first of its kind to pull the Equifax credit report and incorporate it with the counseling information. </p>
                    <p>As you can see I have always on some level been involved with technology in some way. I am currently in a Web Development Bootcamp that I hope will expand my knowledge in the current web based landscape.</p>
